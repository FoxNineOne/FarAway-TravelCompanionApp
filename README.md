# Far Away - A Travel Companion App

## Overview
Far Away is travel companion app that allows you to list all items you need to pack for a trip.
Once packed, you can tick them off, and see a report in the footer of how many items packed, and how much in % is complete.
You can also remove items, and sort them.

This is my first React project, showcasing what I've learnt so far.

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Current Features
- User-configurable list - add, what items you need to pack
- Delete items from the list one by one, or all at once
- You can sort items by description name, packed status, or the order they were inputted

## Live Demo
Current version available at:  🔗 https://faraway-foxnineone.netlify.app/

## What I Learned
- Using State and Props to pass data to child elements from Parents
- Sorting input arrays created from the front-end 
- Using derived state to create dynamic variables over multiple variables that require their own functions to recalculate, this reducing code and re-rendering.

## How to Run Locally
